# service-backup.sh
Create incremental backups on a server, run via crontab

The script could be made to use passed variables, but at the moment the scale is not such that it seems nessisary.
The script is meant to be completely configurable via the variables at the top, which are heavily commented.

My goal is for it to be flexible enough to backup anything with a reasonable scope incrementally, without being a pain to maintain or setup.

If somehow you find this project without being referred by me, please shoot me a message, I'm curious to see if it's useful to you.

Thanks!
